+ Unit tests in place for network client however it’s not properly tested;
- No separation of concerns, the code is very tightly coupled which make unit testing harder like CLLocationManager inside MasterViewController.
- There is no need to make Result object as it’s already built in swift 5 and this project is targeting swift 5, that’s also reflect that the candidate is not up to date with the language updates.
- Usage of "force unwrapping !" in the code which is can lead to App crashes. For example In AppDelegate line 19,20,21
