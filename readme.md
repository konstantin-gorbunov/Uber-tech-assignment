# Foursquare viewer
The simple application for display results from the Foursquare API.

Based on the Master-Details application template from XCode (iPad supported).

Default standard MVC architecture is using. 

I don't see a reason in MVP or MVVC at that example. 

Looks on https://github.com/konstantin-gorbunov/MVx-Patterns-In-Swift if you need more details.

No 3rd party frameworks. They are not necessary.

Load it and launch. Just do it!



Unit test:
- related only to Foursquare download and parsing mechanism.

Problem:
- Foursquare has a very small limit for photos and details request per one application.
